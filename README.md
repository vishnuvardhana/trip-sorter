# Trip Sorter

1. Trip sorter aims to show fastest(cost - discount) and cheapest routes for a given soruce and destination using graph search.

2. All possible trips are acquired from the json file in `app/scripts/response.json`

3. Given a valid route it will have any/all modes of transportation (train,bus,car) from source to destination.

# Assumptions 

1. If the fastest trip to a destination has same duration (cheapest in fastest is considered)
2. Departure and arrival can not be same
